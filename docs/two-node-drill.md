# Two-node release drill

Run this drill manually from a controller with root SSH access to two disposable
Linux VMs. For the literal NAT acceptance test, place each VM behind a different NAT
with outbound UDP allowed and no inbound port forwarding. Use a deployed Australian
coordinator and relay, two short-lived single-use join keys, and a pinned agent tag.

Install only published packages on both clean VMs using the tagged
`scripts/install-agent.sh`. Confirm both report the expected version. Then, on the
controller checkout for that same tag:

```sh
export VM1=root@vm-one.example
export VM2=root@vm-two.example
export COORD=https://coord.example.org
export JOIN_KEY1='set without writing to disk'
export JOIN_KEY2='set without writing to disk'
PREINSTALLED=1 scripts/two-vm-test.sh
unset JOIN_KEY1 JOIN_KEY2
```

Leave `ENDPOINT1` and `ENDPOINT2` unset to exercise relay/NAT fallback. The script
waits for peer convergence, then proves bidirectional IPv4, IPv6, and MagicDNS. Save
the coordinator/relay/agent logs showing relay fallback and any later nonce-confirmed
direct promotion; redact public socket addresses and never attach credentials.

For development, set `BLAKTAILD` to a locally built Linux binary instead of
`PREINSTALLED=1`. That mode tests code but does **not** satisfy release-artifact
acceptance.

After recording results, revoke both disposable nodes with `blaktaild down` or the
console, stop their agent processes, and destroy the VMs. This drill is intentionally
manual until a verified self-hosted runner with nested-virtualisation/NAT capability
is available; ordinary hosted CI is not equivalent to the required topology.
